FDPS SPH - Framwork for Developing Particle Simulator - Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics
===========================================================

About
-----

FDPS SPH is a smoothed particle hydrodynamics code for simulating
impacts of terrestrial bodies. It is build on the FDPS particle
simulation framework.


Installation instructions
-------------------------

The steps to install the necessary dependencies and FDPS itself are described
in the [manual](TODO create link). If you encounter
problems during the installation, please open a Github issue. 


Running FDPS SPH
----------------------------

Instructions on how to run and extend, as well as on how to interpret the
output of FDPS SPH can be found in the [manual](TODO create link). 

Contributing to FDPS SPH
----------------------

FDPS SPH is currently in an early development state. We welcome contributions
from everyone, but we ask to open an issue first to discuss your ideas.
The code structure and user interface can change significantly until
our first release, so only start using and modifying FDPS SPH if you
are comfortable with that premise.

It is our goal to build an inclusive
and participatory community so we are happy that you are interested in
participating!
