This folder is a simple pipeline to use to generate input files for FDPS_SPH.

Use bodies_inputtxt.py for generating input files for bodies/mode 1. This creates imp.txt, tar.txt and a .sh job file, that are moved to their respective folders. Use the job file to start the bodies relaxation in the main directory of FDPS_SPH!

For a quick check, use the profiles.py script to look at profiles after their relaxation/at a given time of the relaxation.
Recombine output files with combine_prepare_files.py after the relaxation/a given time of the relaxation.

Finally, use collision_inputtxt.py to generate an input file for a collision. This creates gi.txt and job file, which are to the folders. Start the collision in the main directory!

We tried to documents all inputs and their units to be given. If anything misses, please feel free to edit.
As a general rule, if prompted to give a time when playing with files, give it in seconds. For paths, give the absolute path, e.g., in the form /scratch/username/folder/.

For more info, refer to the manual.
